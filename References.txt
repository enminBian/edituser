The first four websites are all about sessions including one Chinese website. I used session to write the part 2 and 3 but it doesn’t work. So I tried to use database to store the data instead which I didn’t use the reference so I do not have the reference about the database. They are the same way to me. Just store the data in different places. I tried the last two references to write about the time task but it didn’t work. I think the format of the time is incorrect so I just leave it there.
